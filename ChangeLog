2019-03-16 version 7.0

This major version adds some useful features, new configuration directives
and fix some bugs reported by users since previous release.

New features are:

  * New scan mode. By default squidclamav scan everything excepted the
    exclusions defined in 'abort', 'abortcontent', 'whitelist', 'trustuser'
    and 'trustclient' configuration directives. There is now a mode where
    squidclamav will scan nothing excepted the inclusions defined with
    directives 'scan', 'scancontent', 'blacklist', 'untrustuser' and
    'untrustclient'. The scan mode is controlled by a new configuration
    directive 'scan_mode'. Possible values are 'ScanAllExcept' (the default)
    and 'ScanNothingExcept'.

  * Add support to libarchive to be able to ban archive with some suspect
    files inside that are not detected by ClamAv. This feature is disabled
    by default and can be enable using 'enable_libarchive'. The ban archive
    can be stored to be recovered by the user through the redirect CGI script
    if directive 'recoverpath' is set.

  * An archive banned by libarchive can be recovered through the redirect
    CGI. See cgi-bin/clwarn.cgi and the redirect configuration directive.
    recoverpath must be set to use this feature.

Backward compatibility with version 6 of squidclamav and existing
configuration files is fully preserved except for the obsolete 'squidguard'
directive that has been removed. Chained program using this directive is
no longer supported, use the 'url_rewrite_program' squid.conf directive
instead to call squidGuard or any other Url checker.

  - Pass generated name of the file saved by libarchive mode to recover
    the file through a link in the redirect CGI.
  - Remove obsolete code related to debug and squidguard directives.
  - Remove obsolete squidguard configuration directive.
  - Print less messages at DebugLevel 1 to only display essential messages.
    Remove support to chained program like squidguard using the squidguard
    directive. Use the 'url_rewrite_program' squid.conf directive instead.
  - Add multipart configuration directive to documentation.
  - Add libarchive support (link to recover file) in all CGI scripts.
  - Update documentation and copyrights.
  - Update autoconf/automake files.
  - SquidClamav has a default "ScanAllExcepted" behavior, that mean that
    everything is scanned except the exclusion set in abort, abortcontent
    and whitelist directives. With new directive scan_mode it is now
    possible to reverse the default behavior with mode "ScanNothingExcepted"
    which will scan nothing excepted what is defined in directive scan,
    scancontent and blacklist. Backward compatibility is fully preserved.
    Thanks to Andres Ofner for the feature request.
  - Add new configuration directives scan_mode, scan, scancontent and
    blacklist.
  - Fix some compilation warning with libarchive support and improve multipart
    content-type code.
  - Add documentation about libarchive support.
  - Do not compile code for libarchive support if libarchive is not available
    to preserve backward compatibility.
  - Update autoconf and automake files.
  - Add support to libarchive to be able to exclude archives following their
    content. Thanks to Vieri Di Paola for the patch.
  - Send multipart content-type headers to clamav. Thanks to Paul Winkler for
    the patch.
  - Fix missing prefix for c-icap-config which affects systems where c-icap is
    not installed in the PATH. Thanks to Sebastian Weitzel for the patch.
  - Add debian folder. Thanks to Louis van Belle for the patch.

2016-08-30 version 6.16

bad side effects like printing an error after configuration reload
an possibly some other wrong behaviors.

  - Change log level of configuration reloading message.
  - Show line in configuration file that can not be parsed
    by add_pattern().
  - Enclose debugs macro to avoid miss usage. Thanks to Denis Volpato
    Martins for the patch.
  - Fix Apache complain "AH01215: CGI::param called in list context
    from package main line 14, this can lead to vulnerabilities."
    Thanks to Louis van Belle for the report.

	- Change cast on content_length printing.
	- Fix some issues returned by Coverity scanner.

2014-03-11 version 6.11

This release adds support to icap template allowing to display a templated
response on block instead of redirecting to an external URL. Add new lines
into HTTP and ICAP response header to set X-Infection-Found and X-Virus-ID
when a virus is found. With the possiblity to scan data sent without preview
this allow some commercial product like MoveIt DMZ to work with c-icap and
squidclamav service. Lot of code clean up and bug fixes.

	- Add X-Infection-Found and X-Virus-ID into icap response header.
	  This allow some commercial product like MoveIt DMZ to work with
	  c-icap/squidclamav service.
	- Fix compilation issue with c-icap 1.6.x versions. Old version of
	  c-icap ( < 0.2.x ) does not support icap template, this is now
	  detected at configure time. Thanks to Graham Har for the report.
	- Remove preview data enabling from mandatory option.
	- Allow use of non HTTP request used by ICAP client like c-icap-client
	  or request from commercial product such as Move It DMZ. For example:
	    c-icap-client -i 127.0.0.1 -p 1344 -f eicar.zip \
	    -s "squidclamav?allow204=on&force=on&sizelimit=off&mode=simple" -v
	  Thanks to Henry ken for the feature request.
	- Update Copyright
	- Udapte auto generated configuration and make files and fix several
	  compile time warning from squidclamav.c. Also fix an error message
	  wrongly displayed at squidclamav.conf fd close time.
	- Add MALWARE_FOUND icap template that will be displayed by Squid when
	  a malware is found instead of redirecting to the CGI (when redirect
	  configuration directive is not defined).
	- Tested squidclamav with c-icap 0.3.2
	- When there's no clamd running, die. bypass should be in the proxy
	  setup instead of in squidclamav code. Thanks to Peter Molnar for
	  the patch.
	- Clean up HTTP Response headers. Thanks to Peter Molnar for the patch.
	- Fix conflicting types for strnstr on freeBSD. Thanks to Mathias H for
	  the report.
	- Fix an issue on FreeBSD with squidclamav.conf parser reporting fatal
	  error into add_pattern.
	- Remove all of the built-in format tokens - these are included by c-icap,
	  so no need to duplicate them here. Thanks to Nathan Hoad for the patch.
	- Fix documentation about using template instead or redirect URL.
	- Lots of code cleanup and debugs method, similar to what Squid uses.
	  Thanks to Nathan Hoad for the patch.
	- Updated all documentation to mention new behaviour in the absence of
	  the redirection option. Thanks to Nathan Hoad for the patch.
	- Displaying a templated response on block instead of redirecting.
	  It supports all the format tokens that the LogFormat directive supports,
	  plus %mn for displaying the virus name as identified by ClamAV. Thanks
	  to Nathan Hoad for the patch.
	- Don't stub out __FUNCTION__ unless we're definitely on Solaris. Thanks
	  to Nathan Hoad for the patch.
	- Provide a macro to make debug messages much nicer. This updates messages
	  to display logs like so:
	      squidclamav.c(252) squidclamav_close_service: DEBUG clean all memory!
	  This makes debugging both nicer to read and write. Thanks to Nathan Hoad
	  for the patch.
	- Remove xfree, as any respectable compiler (i.e. one that follows the C
	  standard) won't crash if you call free(3) on NULL. Thanks to Nathan Hoad
	  for the patch.
	- Normalise indentation and remove all trailing whitespace. No functional
	  changes. Thanks to Nathan Hoad for the patch.

2012-10-27 version 6.10

        - Replace clamd STREAM by zINSTREAM protocol as clamav have removed
          the obsolete STREAM protocol in release 0.97.4. Thanks to Vasan and
          Raja Lakshmi for the report.

2012-08-26 version 6.9

	- Add 'safebrowsing' configuration directive to enable/disable
	  Safe Browsing detection.
	- Fix support to Clamav Google Safe Browsing that need a second
	  query to clamd because the url need to be embeded in an email
	  like content. Thanks to frOgz for the report.
	- Documentation updated for safebrowsing and proxy configuration
	  variables.
	- All redirect CGI scripts have been rewritten with some CSS and
	  to better handle virus vs malware. Thanks to frOgz for the patches.
	- Tested SquidClamav with Squid 3.2 successfuly.

2012-07-26 version 6.8

	- Compatibility fix with new c-icap 0.2.1 release that prevent
	  squidclamav service to be initialized. Thanks to Martin Matuska
	  for the patch.
	- Fix issue with new c-icap 0.2.1 release that generate an error
	  error each time squidclamav return CI_MOD_204 in end of data
	  handler function. Thanks to Martin Matuska or the patch.

2012-07-24 version 6.7

	- Add a workaround for a squidGuard bug that unescape the URL and
	  send it back unescaped. This result in garbage staying into pipe
	  of the system command call and could crash squidclamav on next
	  read or return false information. This is specially true with URL
	  containing the %0D or %0A character. Thanks to John Xue for the
	  report.
	- Update documentation about the recommanded way to call squidGuard
	  through the use of url_rewrite_program in squid.conf. You may not
	  use the squidguard configuration directive into squidclamav.conf.

2012-05-28 version 6.6

	- Rewrite entirely the squidclamav behavior with the maxsize directive.
	  The previous fix was only a workaround.
	- Fix a bug on 'trustclient' check part that was never executed if
	  dnslookup was disabled. Thanks to Tinu for the report.

2012-01-15 version 6.5

	- Fix a squidclamav crash when maxsize is removed from configuration
	  file or disabled/set to 0. Thanks to Pascal Bendeich for the report.
	- Fix an issue when downloaded file size is upper than clamd.conf limit
	  set into the StreamMaxLength configuration directive. Thanks to Arnvid
	  Karstad for the report.
	- All cgi Perl script have been modified to report unsafe browsing.
	- Add a note about ClamAV and the support for Google Safe Browsing
	  database. As clamd will returned something like:
		Safebrowsing.<something> FOUND
	  this will be redirected by squidclamav just like if a virus was found.
	  Thanks to Michael Grasso for the request.


2011-08-19 version 6.4

	- Change default value for clamd_local configuration directive to the
	  common package default clamd local socket '/var/run/clamav/clamd.ctl'.
	- The origin of the double free corruption was partially found in last
	  release. It is now completely fixed. Thanks to Tim Weippert for the
	  report.
	- The call to squidGuard from SquidClamav by a bidirectional pipe seem
	  to make squid/c-icap system going slower and slower. The reason comes
	  from more and more pending squidGuard processes after c-icap thread
	  restarting. The historical reason of this feature is related to Squid
	  version 2.x that doesn't allow to chained url_rewrite_program. I think
	  this is no more useful so the squidguard configuration directive will
	  be removed in next major release. Thank to Marco Schuth and David
	  Tannheimeri for the report.
	  You'd better use the Squid configuration file (squid.conf) and the
	  'url_rewrite_program' directive to use squidGuard. There's no plan to
	  reintroduce the call to squidGuard from SquidClamav at least until
	  squidGuard has a daemon mode or you really asked for it.
	- Fix an issue on reallocating mishandled null pattern array.


2011-06-26 version 6.3

	- Remove obsolete code on log_file configuration directive.
	- Fix double free corruption when sending a configuration reload
	  command: echo -n "squidclamav:cfgreload" >> /var/run/c-icap/c-icap.ctl
	  Thanks to David Tannheimer for the report. This bug appears only when
	  using local Unix socket to connect clamd.
	- Compatibility check with c-icap-0.1.6: ok

2011-02-26 version 6.2

	- Fix squidclamav crash when X-Client-IP is not forwarded by default
	  from squid to icap, i-e: when 'icap_send_client_ip on' is not set
	  into squid.conf. Thanks to Diego Elio Pettenò for the patch.
	- Force client Ip and Username to '-' when they are not set or null.
	  Thanks to Alex for the report.
	- Fix a signal 11 when username was not set.
	- Add new configuration option 'dnslookup' to disable DNS lookup of
	  client ip address. Default is enabled for backward compatibility but
	  you may desactivate this feature if you don't use trustclient with
	  hostname in the regexp. Disabling it will also speed up squidclamav.

2010-10-29 version 6.1

	- Add missing "#include <signal.h>", compilation on BSD and possibly
	  other distribution was not working. Thanks to Alex for the report.
	- Fix segmentation fault by gethostbyaddr when remote client can't be
	  resolved. Thank to Valery for the report.

2010-10-21 version 6.0

	This is the initial release of the v6.x branch. It works exactly as
	v5.x branch except that it now use the ICAP protocol and must be run
	as a c-icap server service. The goal of this first release is to port
	SquidClamav to the ICAP protocol to solve all limitations encountered
	in the previous releases (audio/video streaming, site with session like
	webmail, support of POST request, etc).

	Next release will tend to have real on stream scanning and bypass the
	size limitation. Coming soon, but I first want to be sure that c-icap
	is the good choose for stability and performance but also that this new 
	branch is stable and speed enough. I hope you make me feedback.

	This release needs squid v3.x and the c-icap server.

	Also there's no packaging available yet.

	The squidclamav.conf configuration file from v5.x is fully compatible
	but some directives are now obsolete, here is the list:

		squid_ip
		squid_port
		maxredir
		useragent
		trust_cache
		stat
		debug
		clamd_timeout

	One have change, this is the 'timeout' directive that was used to set
	the timeout for libcurl download. As cURL is no more used, this timeout
	directive is now used to set the timeout for clamd connect. His default
	value is 1 second and can be set up to 10.

	Others works as before.

	YOU MUST tune the c-icap server following your need (number of users),
	see http://squidclamav.darold.net/tuning.html for the configuration
	directive that could help.
