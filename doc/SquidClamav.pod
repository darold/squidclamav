SquidClamav v6 - HTTP Antivirus for Squid based on ClamAv and the ICAP protocol

=head1 DESCRIPTION

SquidClamav v6 is an antivirus for the Squid proxy based on the ICAP protocol
and the Awards winnings ClamAv anti-virus toolkit. Using it will help you
securing your home or enterprise network web traffic. SquidClamav is the most
efficient antivirus tool for HTTP traffic available for free, it is written
in C as a c-icap service and can handle several thousands of connections.

Previous versions was only working as Squid Redirector but this had some
bad limitations and breaks many sites using cookies and post HTTP method. The
reason is that older squidclamav release (< 6.0) had to request through libcurl
the URL given by Squid to download the file and scan it. But this URL doesn't
include the post parameters nor any header information like cookies. The other
advantage is that you can now scan video/audio streaming without problem.

SquidClamav v6 bypass theses limitations by only scanning the HTTP stream sent
by Squid through the ICAP server. It don't make HTTP request itself so this is
a gain of performance and ensure that the data scanned are the same that the
user has requested.

Why use c-icap server? This is the only open source icap server written in C,
that mean it is very fast and as I know/tested stable enough. I don't have time
to write my own so I think this is the best choice. If you don't think so and
reports me too many problems related to c-icap don't worry I will help to make
it better otherwise I will write my own but the best choice is to help c-icap.

Why writing and other clamav c-icap module? Well, to be honest, outside the
survival of SquidClamav, I think that using clamd instead of libclamav to scan
files is speediest and more simple than the srv_clamav module provided with the
c-icap server. The other argument is that you can have your own redirect page
like with previous version of SquidClamav. And to ending this part SquidGuard
can still be call and used like in previous release, It means faster and with
dedicated redirect page defined in your squidGuard configuration file.

SquidClamav v6 is still faster than any others and can handle several thousands
of simultaneous users, this is what we need.

The other unique feature of SquidClamav is that you can have Clamd failover by
setting up to 4 clamd server ip address. When a clamd server is not reachable
in the second, SquidClamav switch the next ip address.

If you are using ClamAV above 0.95, SquidClamav will have support for Google
Safe Browsing database. All signatures provided by Google Safe Browsing Database
will be prefixed with the Safebrowsing tag. If ClamAV reports:

	Safebrowsing.<something> FOUND

this will be redirected by squidclamav just like if a virus was found.


=head1 USAGE

=head2 Generic Program Information

SquidClamav v6 has been completely rewritten to be use through the Squid v3.x
ICAP feature allowing "on stream" scanning. It is now built as a c-icap server
service but keeps all features from v5 and is fully compatible with the old
SquidClamav configuration file. The squidclamav configuration file is unchanged
minus some obsoletes directives.

This also mean that SquidClamav can no more be run into an interactive console
for testing your URL. All debug information will now goes to the c-icap logfile.

=head2 Installing Squid

=head2 Setting SquidClamav as Squid Icap service

I want SquidClamav as c-icap service to be installed and configured the more
easier as possible and compatible with the old configuration file. This mean
that I voluntary omit some capabilities of c-icap server to preserve a full
compatibility with the old squidclamav.conf file.

=head3 Squid v3.x installation and configuration

To have full and stable icap support with Squid you must use the 3.x branch
and configure squid with the following option:

	--enable-icap-client

I don't know what other options you are using but you have to add this one
to your configure command. If you prefer to use distribution packaging you
may already have it configured if you can install the c-icap package too.

If you don't know, run the following command an search for the configuration
directive: --enable-icap-client

	/usr/local/squid/sbin/squid -v | grep "enable-icap-client"

If it is not enable you must reinstall Squid with this configuration option or
install the additional packages.

Once you have it enabled, to integrate c-icap and SquidClamav to your squid
cache just edit squid.conf and set the following directives.

=over 4

=item Squid 3.1.x configuration

There's some configuration difference between 3.1.x and 3.0.x Squid version.
Here are those I use for Squid 3.1.x:

	icap_enable on
	icap_send_client_ip on
	icap_send_client_username on
	icap_client_username_encode off
	icap_client_username_header X-Authenticated-User
	icap_preview_enable on
	icap_preview_size 1024
	icap_service service_req reqmod_precache bypass=1 icap://127.0.0.1:1344/squidclamav
	adaptation_access service_req allow all
	icap_service service_resp respmod_precache bypass=1 icap://127.0.0.1:1344/squidclamav
	adaptation_access service_resp allow all

If you don't know where to put them in squid.conf, just search for 'icap_.*'
and add those configuration lines at the end of the icap section.

Here the bypass is set to 1, that mean that in case of ICAP problem squid will
simply ignore the error and continue. This is the equivalent of the bridge mode
in version 5.x. I recommand to disable this feature when you want to check the
load on your server to be able to tune c-icap and clamd.


=item Squid 3.0.x configuration

For squid 3.0.x you must replace 'bypass=1' by '1' or 'bypass=0' by '0' and
the access to the service is defined at a class level. Only the last fourth
configuration line change from version 3.1.x.

	icap_enable on
	icap_send_client_ip on
	icap_send_client_username on
	icap_client_username_encode off
	icap_client_username_header X-Authenticated-User
	icap_preview_enable on
	icap_preview_size 1024
	icap_service service_req reqmod_precache 1 icap://127.0.0.1:1344/squidclamav
	icap_service service_resp respmod_precache 1 icap://127.0.0.1:1344/squidclamav
	icap_class class_avreq service_req
	icap_class class_avresp service_resp
	icap_access class_avreq allow all
	icap_access class_avresp allow all

If you don't know where to put them in squid.conf, just search for 'icap_.*'
and add those configuration lines at the end of the icap section.

Here the bypass is set to 1, that mean that in case of ICAP problem squid will
simply ignore the error and continue. This is the equivalent of the bridge mode
in version 5.x. I recommand to disable this feature when you want to check the
load on your server to be able to tune c-icap and clamd.

=back

What that configuration directives do? It enables the ICAP client into Squid and
tells Squid to send the logged username and client's Ip to the ICAP server. It
also enable preview for faster SquidClamav work. The last four lines defined how
to call the ICAP server. Here we call the squidclamav service on localhost and
port 1344 but it can be on any other host and port. The bypass parameter set
to 1 mean that Squid will continue without bothering about ICAP server or
SquidClamav failure. This is just like the old bridge mode in the SquidClamav
previous release. I don't want users to be bored by a continuously error message
if SquidClamav or c-icap have failure or if there's an error in configuration
file. Users don't have to know about that, they want to surf and don't care
about your problems :-) If you don't think like me, just set the bypass argument
to 0 and Squid will return an error message on failure.

=head3 C-icap server installation/configuration

If you don't have package solution or encounter problem to install SquidClamav
I recommand you to install the c-icap server from source as follow. You can
download it from SourceForge at http://c-icap.sourceforge.net/. Choose version
c-icap-0.1.2 and later versions, then run:

	./configure --prefix=/usr/local/c-icap --enable-large-files
	make
	make install

Then, edit the file /usr/local/c-icap/etc/c-icap.conf. It contains a set of
documented values that configure the c-icap server. To enable the support of
SquidClamav just add the following line to the end of the file:

	Service squidclamav squidclamav.so

Don't care about the srv_clamav.* configuration directives this will not breaks
anything. SquidClamav do not use them but read its own directives from the file
/etc/squidclamav.conf

You can disable the c-icap embedded modules by commenting the lines:

	#Service url_check_module srv_url_check.so
	#Service antivirus_module srv_clamav.so

this will preserve some resources.

Following your installation you may need to create the /var/run/c-icap/ where
c-icap server is writing pid and socket file.

You may also want to change the user/group owning c-icap's processes. By default
the owner is the user/group who runs the program. I recommand you to change them
to the same user/group running your Squid cache. For example:

	User proxy
	Group proxy

of course you will need to change the owner of directory /var/run/c-icap/ and
the directory of your server log. See the ServerLog directive to know the path.
For me, I use the following commands to set the good rights on my installation:

	mkdir /var/run/c-icap/
	chown -R proxy:proxy /var/run/c-icap/
	chown -R proxy:proxy /usr/local/c-icap/

After that you can run the c-icap server as explain below.

=head3 SquidClamav installation/configuration

Installing SquidClamav require that you already have installed the c-icap as
explain above. You must provide the installation path of c-icap to the configure
command as follow:

	./configure --with-c-icap=/usr/local/c-icap/
	make
	make install

this will install the squidclamav.so library into the c-icap modules/services
repository.

=head3 Runing c-icap server

Finally, you can run the c-icap server as root user:

	/usr/local/c-icap/bin/c-icap

Or any other path to the binary. If you want to display debugging information
on the terminal, the previous command should be executed with the following
arguments:

	/usr/local/c-icap/bin/c-icap -N -D -d 10

The first argument -N prevents the c-icap server from forking in the background,
the second argument -D enables the printing of messages to standard output, and
the third argument -d 10 enables the printing of full debugging information.

=head3 Reloading configuration without restarting the c-icap server

To force SquidClamav to reread his configuration file after change you can
send the following command to the c-icap server

	echo -n "squidclamav:cfgreload" > /var/run/c-icap/c-icap.ctl

It will reread all his configuration directive and restart pipes to squidGuard.
So if you make changes to squidGuard you must execute this command to activate
them into SquidClamav.

Or to be sure that all is really initialized or that you have made change to the
c-icapi configuration file you can run the following command:

	echo -n "reconfigure" > /var/run/c-icap/c-icap.ctl

The service will reread the config file without the need for stop and restart
the c-icap server. The services will be reinitialized.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

By default, the configuration file must be /etc/squidclamav.conf, you can not
use an other path unless you change it in the source code (see src/squidclamav.h).

SquidClamav installation will create a default file with the maximum security
level. If you have low resource on your server there's some predefined pattern
optimized for speed. Feel free to modify it to match your security level.

The format of the configuration file consists in always lower case configuration
directives name followed by a value. The name and the value must be separated by
a single space character. Comments are lines starting with a '#' character.

=head2 Global configuration

=head3 Log file and debug

In version 6.x the directives 'logfile', 'debug' and 'stat' are obsoletes as
logging and debug are now handle by the c-icap server. You can control them
using the c-icap.conf directives:

	ServerLog /usr/local/c-icap/var/log/server.log
	DebugLevel 0

Debug informations are disable by default, do not enable it on production
server as it cost a lot of system performance. The debug level can be set
from 1 up to 3 for SquidClamav but can be up to 10 for c-icap.

=head3 Clamd daemon

SquidClamav need to know where to contact clamd, the ClamAv daemon, for on
stream virus scanning.

	clamd_local /tmp/clamd
	#clamd_ip 192.168.1.5
	#clamd_port 3310

By default SquidClamav will contact clamd locally on the /tmp/clamd unix socket
(clamd_local). If your clamd daemon use INET socket or stay in a remote server,
you have to set the ip address and the port with clamd_ip and clamd_port.

If you use INET socket the 'clamd_local' directive must be commented else
SquidClamav will always used the clamd_local directive.

=head3 Clamd failover

If you have multiple ClamAv servers, SquidClamav is able to do failover between
them. You just have to set 'clamd_ip' to a list of ip adresses separated by a
coma. Do not insert space character in this list it will break all. For example:

	clamd_ip 192.168.1.5,192.168.1.13,192.168.1.9
	clamd_port 3310
	timeout 1

You can set up to 5 clamd server. The clamd port must be the same for all these
server as 'clamd_port' only accept one value.

SquidClamav will always connect to the first available ip address. If it can not
connect after 1 second it will try the next defined ip address. When a connect
can be establish SquidClamav will reuse this last "working" ip address first to
not slow down process the next time.

If you think 1 second is a low value, you can change the connect timeout by
editing file squidclamav.conf and set the 'timeout' directive to a higher value.For example :

	timeout 2

Value must be set in second. Do not set it too high (< 5) or you can slow down
everything.

=head3 Redirection

When a virus is detected SquidClamav need to redirect the client to a warning
page. You can find in the SquidClamav distribution a set of Perl CGI scripts
with different language that you can use. To specify this redirection you have
to use the 'redirect' directive as follow:

	redirect http://proxy.samse.fr/cgi-bin/clwarn.cgi

Take a look in the cgi-bin directory to see all translation of this cgi script.

Squidclamav will pass to this CGI the following parameters:

	url=ORIGNAL_HTTP_REQUEST
	virus=NAME_OF_THE_VIRUS
	source=DOWNLOADER_IP_ADDRESS
	user=DOWNLOADER_IDENT

To log every chained program redirection enable the 'logredir' configuration
directive as follow:

	logredir 1

By default it is disabled as you can also log this information with the cgi-script or send an email.

=head3 Chained Url Checker

This directive is preserved for bacward compatibility but you must remove it
from your configuration file as it could result in many squidclamav crash.
Please use the 'url_rewrite_program' squid.conf directive instead to call
squidGuard.

	url_rewrite_program /usr/bin/squidGuard
	url_rewrite_children 15
	url_rewrite_access allow all

If you still want to use it, SquidClamav allow you to chain the SquidGuard
program to check the Url requested against blocklists using the 'squidguard'
directive. You just have to give the path to the program.

	squidguard /usr/local/squidGuard/bin/squidGuard

The chained program is called before the virus scan and any other SquidClamav
operation. The call to this program can be disable with the 'whitelist',
'trustuser' and 'trustclient' directives see SquidClamav Patterns for more
information.

To log every chained program redirection enable the 'logredir' configuration
directive as follow:

	logredir 1

By default it is disabled as you can also log this information with squidguard.

=head3 Maxsize

This directive allow to completely disable virus scan for files bigger than the
value in bytes. Default is 0, no size limit as you may want to control download
size into squid.conf or clamd.

	maxsize 2000000

If you want to abort virus scan after a certain amount of data you must take a
look at the clamd configuration directive 'StreamMaxLength' that will close
stream when the given size is reach.

=head2 Controlling SquidClamav behaviour

As in SquidClamav v5.x, v6.0 will scan all downloaded files by default.
You have five directives to control the way things must work.

All these directives used extended regex pattern matching and are case
insensitive.

=head3 Control both chained program and virus scan

There's 3 configuration directives that allow you to disable virus scan and
call to chained redirector like SquidGuard. Those pattern matching are searched
as soon as a Squid entry is received.

=over 4

=item whitelist

The 'whitelist' configuration directive allow you to disable chained program
and virus scan at URL level. When the given pattern match the URL SquidClamav
fallback to Squid instantly.

For example:

	whitelist \.clamav\.net

will deliver any files from hosts on clamav.net domain directly.

=item trustuser

The 'trustuser' directive allow you to disable chained program and virus scan
when an ident match the search pattern. On regex found SquidClamav fallback to
Squid instantly. Of course you must have Squid authentication helper enabled.

For example:

	trustuser administrator

will let user logged as administrator to not be bored by chained program and
virus scan.

=item trustclient

The 'trustclient' directive allow you to disable chained program and virus scan
if the client source ip address or DNS name match the search pattern. The source
ip address can be a single ip or a network following the given regex pattern.

For example:

	trustclient ^192\.168\.1\.1$
	trustclient ^192\.168\.1\..*$
	trustclient ^mypc\.domain\.dom$

The first and the last entry will disable chained program and virus scan for a
single computer and the second will do for en entire class C network.

=item dnslookup

Enable / disable DNS lookup of client ip address. Default is enabled '1' to
preserve backward compatibility but you must desactivate this feature if you
don't use trustclient with hostname in the regexp or if you don't have a DNS
on your network. Disabling it will also speed up squidclamav.

=back

=head3 Control virus scan

There's 3 configuration directives that allow you to disable virus scan for
downloaded files.

=over 4

=item abort

The 'abort' directive will let you disable virus scanning at URL level (not
chained program). When the URL match the regex pattern SquidClamav fallback to
Squid immediately after the call to the chained program if there's one defined.

For example:

	abort \.squid-cache\.org
	abort .*\.(png|gif|jpg)$

The first regexp will exclude from virus scanning any file hosted on domain
squid-cache.org, the last one will exclude all PNG, GIF and JPEG image from
scanning.

=item abortcontent

The 'abortcontent' directive allow you to exclude from virus scanning any file
whose Content-Type match the regex pattern. This directive cost more time
because SquidClamav need to download the HTTP header for a file with a HEAD
request. Note that some sites do not answer to HEAD request so content type
could not be retrieved so they will be scanned.

Example:

	abortcontent ^image\/.*$
	abortcontent ^video\/x-flv$

The first directive will complete the "abort .*\.(png|gif|jpg)$" previous
directive to match dynamic image or with parameters at end. The second will
allow your users to view streamed video instantly.

=item maxsize

As said above, the 'maxsize' directive allow you to not scan a file when the
content-length of the file is bigger than the defined value. By default there's
no size limit.

=back

=head3 Safebrowsing

ClamAV 0.95 introduced support for Google Safe Browsing database.
The database is packed inside a CVD file and distributed through our mirror network as safebrowsing.cvd .
This feature is disabled by default on all installations and should be enabled with extreme care.

All signatures provided by Google Safe Browsing Database will be prefixed with the Safebrowsing tag. If ClamAV reports Safebrowsing.<something> FOUND, it means that the advisory was provided by Google and not by ClamAV Virus database.

Please note that such reports do NOT necessarily mean that the data scanned contains some malware. You should treat such data as a potential risk, that is a suspicious source of malware.

If you want to know more about the potentially dangerous data matched by the signature, you should visit http://www.antiphishing.org/ (for phishing warnings) or http://www.stopbadware.org/ (for malware warnings).

In order to enable this feature, you must add “SafeBrowsing Yes” to freshclam.conf .
There is no option in clamd.conf. If the engine finds Google Safe Browsing files in the database directory, ClamAV will enable safe browsing. To turn it off you need to update freshclam.conf and remove the safebrowsing files from the database directory before restarting clamd. 


=head2 Testing SquidClamav

As SquidClamav v6.0 is now a c-icap service it can no more be run at console
in interactive mode. To check what is going wrong you must edit c-icap.conf
fine and set DebugLevel to 3 and enable ServerLog. Then check for line with
squidclamav string into the log file defined with ServerLog.

=head2 Performances

With SquidClamav v6.x the way to tune your service is to tune c-icap server and
clamd daemon. On heavy http acces, putting the clamd daemon on a dedicated
server with mutilple CPU will really help.

If you experience Squid "ICAP protocol error" (with bypass enabled) please
consider increasing the c-icap following parameters: StartServers, MaxServers,
MinSpareThreads, MaxSpareThreads, ThreadsPerChild. Increase also in clamd.conf
parameter: MaxThreads may help.
