# When a virus is found then redirect the user to this URL. If this directive
# is disabled squidclamav will use c-icap error templates to report issues.
redirect http://proxy.domain.dom/cgi-bin/clwarn.cgi

# Path to the squiGuard binary if you want URL filtering, note that you'd better
# use the squid configuration directive 'url_rewrite_program' instead.
#squidguard /usr/local/squidGuard/bin/squidGuard

# Path to the clamd socket, use clamd_local if you use Unix socket or if clamd
# is listening on an Inet socket, comment clamd_local and set the clamd_ip and
# clamd_port to the corresponding value.

# Set the timeout for clamd connection. Default is 1 second, this is a good
# value but if you have slow service you can increase up to 3.

# Force SquidClamav to log all virus detection or squiguard block redirection
# to the c-icap log file.

# Enable / disable DNS lookup of client ip address. Default is enabled '1' to
# preserve backward compatibility but you must desactivate this feature if you
# don't use trustclient with hostname in the regexp or if you don't have a DNS
# on your network. Disabling it will also speed up squidclamav.

# Enable / Disable Clamav Safe Browsing feature. You mus have enabled the
# corresponding behavior in clamd by enabling SafeBrowsing into freshclam.conf
# Enabling it will first make a safe browsing request to clamd and then the
# virus scan request.
