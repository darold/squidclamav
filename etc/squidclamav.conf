# Maximum size of a file that may be scanned. Any file bigger that this value
# will not be scanned. If libarchive support is enable the value must be upper
# than banmaxsize otherwise this is the value of banmaxsize that will be taken.
maxsize 5M

# When a virus is found then redirect the user to this URL. If this directive
# is disabled squidclamav will use c-icap error templates to report issues.
redirect http://proxy.domain.dom/cgi-bin/clwarn.cgi

# Path to the clamd socket, use clamd_local if you use Unix socket or if clamd
# is listening on an Inet socket, comment clamd_local and set the clamd_ip and
# clamd_port to the corresponding value.

# Set the timeout for clamd connection. Default is 1 second, this is a good
# value but if you have slow service you can increase up to 3.
timeout 1

# Force SquidClamav to log all virus detection or squiguard block redirection
# to the c-icap log file.

# Enable / disable DNS lookup of client ip address. Default is enabled '1' to
# preserve backward compatibility but you must desactivate this feature if you
# don't use trustclient with hostname in the regexp or if you don't have a DNS
# on your network. Disabling it will also speed up squidclamav.
dnslookup 1

# Enable / Disable Clamav Safe Browsing feature. You mus have enabled the
# corresponding behavior in clamd by enabling SafeBrowsing into freshclam.conf
# Enabling it will first make a safe browsing request to clamd and then the
# virus scan request.

# Send the Content-Type header to Clamav for multipart content types
# so multipart bodies can be broken up by their boundary and each part
# can be scanned.
multipart 0

# SquidClamav can be run in two mode. The first and default one is the
# "ScanAllExcept" mode that will scan everything by default and can be
# controlled by the abort, abortcontent, whitelist, trustuser and
# trustclient directives. The second mode is "ScanNothingExcept" that
# will scan nothing but the content controlled by the scan, scancontent,
# blacklist, untrustuser and untrustclient directives.
